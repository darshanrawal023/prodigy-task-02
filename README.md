Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
 Diving into Data with the Titanic Dataset ðŸš¢
I recently worked on a project performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Through this process, I explored relationships between variables, identified key patterns and trends, and uncovered insights into survival rates and their influencing factors.

This project strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and storytelling, reinforcing the importance of EDA as a foundation for any data science workflow.

Excited to keep exploring data and unlocking its hidden stories!
