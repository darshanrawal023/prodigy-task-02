Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset
This is my first kernal and the objective of this kernal is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling on the Titanic Dataset in order to gather insights and evenutally predicting survior(0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived). Out of the 891 passengers that went on board the titanic, approximately 38% of them got surived where as majority 62% did not survive the disaster.

I have outlined below the process i followed in conducting the aforementioned procedure

Import the relevant python libraies for the analysis
Load the train and test dataset and set the index if applicable
Visually inspect the head of the dataset,Examine the train dataset to understand in particular if the data is tidy, shape of the dataset,examine datatypes, examine missing values, unique counts and build a data dictictionary dataframe
Run discriptive statistics of object and numerical datatypes, and finally transform datatypes accordingly
Carry-out univariate,bivariate and multivariate analysis using graphical and non graphical(some numbers represting the data) mediums
